# Introduction

The project I am going to develop is A Faculty Management System, which is simple web web application but kind of useful project .
The goal of this system is to manage all faculty records, generally this type of software is used by A school or University Adminstrators to manage faculty. There are operations performed by thisd system like add faculty, update faculty, delete faculty, search faculty details. Faculty can be enter into the website by using username and password. It is accessible by an adminstrator, Only the admin can add data into the database.

Theough this system faculty can check their records, adminstrator can easily deal this system. Faculty can search other faculty members and they can send requests to the adminstrator if they want to . Adminstrator can update faculty data into rcords by clicking update faculty button.This web applications consist of many module those can helpful in managing faculty. 

# Anticipated Technologies
We can develop this kind of project by using any programming languages but  I am going to use HTML, CSS for the front-end and for the backend PHP and mysql as a database server.

# Method/Approach

I will start my project by setting up all requirements in my personal laptop , like technologies needed to be installed fisrt. After that I will make a plan for this project and by considering the plan I am goona design the application, like what are the modules rquire for this application and how should be the front-end design  all such things i will cover here. After all I will start doing my project by developing front and back-end. 

# Estimated Timeline

I am not sure but it will take two months for me to finish this project from now on. The estimated date is December First week.


# Anticipated Problems

By doing this project I might face problems with backe-end developent, why because I have some experience on front-end development but this is the first time I am developing whole project. So, I need overcome such problems with back-end.
