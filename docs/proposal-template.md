Student and Faculty are both involves in this project, it is like our BlackBoard. This project much helpful in facilitating the  student and faculty.Both Student and faculty can access the application, students can see their personal data or any information about academics and assignments. Faculty can manage all the information related to the their respective class students. 

Through this application student can check their class details and also attendence. Faculty can easily deal with the students by using this web application.If students not able to attend the class because of any reason, they can ask leave throuh this application. This web application consist of many modules to make easy connection between student and faculty.One admin can manaage the whole application, he has the authentication to delete records of students and faculty records .

# Anticipated Technologies
We can develop this kind of project by using any programming languages but  I am going to use HTML, CSS for the front-end and for the backend PHP and mysql as a database server.

# Method/Approach

I will start my project by setting up all requirements in my personal laptop , like technologies needed to be installed fisrt. After that I will make a plan for this project and by considering the plan I am goona design the application, like what are the modules rquire for this application and how should be the front-end design  all such things i will cover here. After all I will start doing my project by developing front and back-end. 

# Estimated Timeline

# Anticipated Problems

By doing this project I might face problems with backe-end developent, why because I have some experience on front-end development but this is the first time I am developing whole project. So, I need overcome such problems with back-end.
